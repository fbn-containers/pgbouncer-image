*pgbouncer is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any target application can be connected to pgbouncer as if it were a PostgreSQL server, and pgbouncer will create a connection to the actual server, or it will reuse one of its existing connections. The aim of pgbouncer is to lower the performance impact of opening new connections to PostgreSQL.*
